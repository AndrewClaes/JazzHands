Home of the Hybrid Saxophone

This project is based around the SparkFun ESP32 Thing.
Following the instructions below,
you can equip any saxophone with extended programmable MIDI-output.
It has a control input and a standard DIN MIDI output. 
The controller can be battery powered and supports charging on 5V USB.

The system makes use of unipolar hall effect switches, mounted near the corresponding moving parts on the body of the saxophone.
Magnets are attached to the corresponding moving parts on the keywork.
